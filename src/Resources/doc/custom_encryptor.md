# Custom encryption class

We can imagine that you want to use your own encryption class, and while that seems like a fine and jolly way to spend a weekend coding, it is actually not recommended to "roll your own crypto". Always use libraries that has been under peer review by security experts

That being said, you can add custom Encryptor classes to shapecode/DoctrineEncryptBundle/Encryptors to implement your own favorite library.
